# Factors that affect the median household income in Baltimore city

# Summary 
There are many factors that can affect the median household income in Baltimore City: population density, employement rate, percentage of high-school degree, diversity and percentage of car ownership. The main business question of this project is to find which one or some of them may have the main influence on the overall outcome and give some advice to improve the household income based on the result. 

# Challenge 

This problem is challenging because there are many different factors that can affect the median household income and it would be hard to distinguish one from another. In order to find them out, we need to use certain math skills to help us find the optimal solution. Another challenge is about the data collection process. The data documentation on the website is not super clear and we have to go through another database to find out the right specifications for the need of this project. 

# Solution

## Data Collection 

## Data Analysis

Our solutions contain two parts: Linear regression and clustering. 

- Linear regression: 

- Clustering: In this section, we implemented the clustering algorithm based on z-values for all of those five factors. The way we select anchors is based on the median household income. We select four anchors according to the quartile: 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. Then, we compared the z-values to those four anchors and assign the record to the minimum value from four results.
